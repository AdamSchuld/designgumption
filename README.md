## Summary

This is a portfolio web site to both flaunt my designer shoes as well as test emerging features of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I like to think of it as my own sandbox rife with opportunities to explore and build.  

## Structure

The structure of this site is built on SASS and Compass, Grunt, and jQuery in case you were interested. The initial commit is a good starting place for your own projects using the same work flow.

## Usage

As a public site, I hope others can use this as a means of exploring code. I only kindly ask that if you use any of the code or information, you throw a little attention my way with a link on your site or attribution.
