    </div>

    <section class="explanation">
        <p><span>Gumption</span> is one of those words that is difficult to pin an exact definition too. The word has vague Scottish origins and has been used colloquially since the 18th century. The most apt characterization of the word is a strange cocktail of ‘grit’, ‘composure’, and ‘resourcefulness’. I would argue that the word’s meaning extends even beyond that. Gumption is an understanding that a struggle will ensue and harboring an enthusiasm and resilience for the encounter. It’s an immersion in the complications; the smile that comes with adversity.

        <h2>Gumption is what cultivates great design.</h2>
